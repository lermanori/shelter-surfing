## 🔧 RECENT FIXES

### Fixed ID Parsing Issues
- **Problem:** Backend was trying to parse CUID string IDs as integers
- **Solution:** Updated all controllers to handle string IDs directly
- **Files:** `server/controllers/shelterController.js`, `server/controllers/requestController.js`

### Fixed Form Input Handling
- **Problem:** InputField components weren't receiving proper event objects
- **Solution:** Updated onChange handlers to extract values from event.target.value
- **Files:** `client/src/pages/ShelterEditPage.jsx`, `client/src/pages/RequestEditPage.jsx`

### Fixed Tags Handling
- **Problem:** Tags were being handled as strings instead of arrays
- **Solution:** Updated form to use checkbox interface and proper array handling
- **Files:** `client/src/pages/ShelterEditPage.jsx`

### Adjusted Request Date for Testing Matching Logic
- **Problem:** Not all shelters appeared as matches due to date restrictions on the request.
- **Solution:** Updated the request date to June 21, 2025, to fall within the availability of all shelters.
- **Result:** All three shelters (Tel Aviv and both Jerusalem listings) now appear as matches for the updated request.
- **Files/Actions:** Used API to update request date and verified matches via GET /matches.

### Fixed Port Conflict Issue
- **Problem:** Backend and frontend were both trying to use port 3000
- **Solution:** Updated backend to use port 3001 in `.env` file
- **Result:** Frontend runs on 3000, backend on 3001, API proxy works correctly

### Fixed Shelter Edit Page Image Upload
- **Problem:** ShelterEditPage and ShelterFormPage were not using the ShelterForm component with image uploads
- **Solution:** Updated both pages to use the ShelterForm component
- **Result:** Image upload components now appear in both create and edit shelter forms
- **Files Updated:** `client/src/pages/ShelterEditPage.jsx`, `client/src/pages/ShelterFormPage.jsx`

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES

### GPS Button Not Verified on Localhost
- **Issue:** GPS functionality requires HTTPS, which is not available on localhost
- **Impact:** GPS button in LocationInput component cannot be fully tested in development
- **Workaround:** Manual location input and autocomplete still work perfectly
- **Solution:** Will be verified once deployed to production with HTTPS
- **Files:** `client/src/components/LocationInput.jsx`, `client/src/hooks/useGPSLocation.js`
